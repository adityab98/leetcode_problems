***** selection sort *****
the slowest of all. quadratic even in best case. repeatedly performs same task without learning, selecting max pos takes n-1 comparisons, selecting second largest takes n-2

selection_sort(A):
	for (i = n - 1; i >= 1; i--)
		max_pos = position of max element in A[0:i]
		if (max_pos != i)
			swap (A[i], A[max_pos])
