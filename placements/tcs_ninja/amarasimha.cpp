/*
 * Amarasimha wanted to know the final position of a person, who starts from 
 * the origin 0 0 and travels per following scheme.
 * He first turns and travels 10 units of distance
 * His second turn is upward for 20 units
 * Third turn is to the left for 30 units
 * Fourth turn is the downward for 40 units
 * Fifth turn is to the right(again) for 50 units
 * â€¦ And thus he travels, every time increasing the travel 
 * distance by 10 units.
 * EG:
 * step1: 10, 0
 * step2: 10, 20
 * step3: -20, 20
 * step4: -20, -20
 * step5: 30, -20
 * step6: 90, -20
 * step7: 90, 70
