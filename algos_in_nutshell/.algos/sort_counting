***** counting sort *****
context: doesn't require a comparison funtcion. need to know something about data beforehand (eg: they're all numbers in range 0-k)
forces: succeeds only because k values form a total ordering for the elements
analysis: 2 passes over the entire array. while execs k times. can only be used in limited situations cuz of k constraint
best: O(n)
avg: O(n)
worst: O(n)
related: array

sort (A)
	create k buckets B
	for i = 0 to n - 1
		B[A[i]]++
	idx = 0
	for i = 0 to k - 1
		while (B[i] > 0)
			A[idx++] = i
			B[i]--
